pocket-watch is a tiny node.js library for comparing the execution performance
of two or more synchronous functions. By executing these function calls in
interleaved batches spread over several iterations, pocket-watch achieves very
consistent results due to the reduced influence of garbage collection or spikes
in background CPU usage.

This makes pocket-watch great for comparing the *relative performance* of two or
more procedures, but not very well suited for establishing their raw ops/s
speed.
